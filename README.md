# APK-Classifier
A script that can detect whether the .apk file was compiled and developed in Ionic, React, Flutter or Native

Feed as many .apk files as you want! The program will output an analysis, with unique properties that could identify the platform where the file was built from.
Also, if many clues are found on diferent platforms, the application will show the most thrustable option and a percentage on how much it's sure about that.
